# 🌟 Overview

Every day millions of CCTV cameras silently record accidents, thefts and suspicious activities.

Unfortunately...

Finding the exact moment of an accident still requires someone to manually watch hours of footage.

Traditional CCTV systems record everything.

**DrishtAI understands everything.**

Instead of merely detecting an accident after it happens, DrishtAI reconstructs the sequence of events leading to the incident and pinpoints the **earliest observable warning** that could have indicated danger.

This transforms passive surveillance into intelligent visual reasoning.

---

# 💡 The Problem

Traditional surveillance systems suffer from several limitations:

- Hours of manual footage review
- No understanding of event sequences
- Difficult incident search
- Delayed emergency response
- Human dependency
- No explanation of why incidents occurred

Imagine reviewing **12 hours** of CCTV footage to locate a collision lasting **less than 5 seconds.**

That is the problem DrishtAI solves.

---

# 🚀 Our Solution

DrishtAI combines

- Computer Vision
- Multi-Object Tracking
- Motion Mathematics
- Event Reasoning
- Timeline Generation
- Large Language Models

into one intelligent pipeline capable of transforming raw CCTV footage into understandable incident reports.

Instead of asking

> "Can you search the video?"

Users simply ask

> **"When did the accident happen?"**

or

> **"What caused the collision?"**

DrishtAI provides the answer within seconds.

# 🏗️ DrishtAI System Architecture

<p align="center">

<img src="assets/architecture.png" width="100%">

</p>

DrishtAI follows a modular AI pipeline where every stage performs one dedicated responsibility before passing structured data to the next stage.

Rather than relying on a single monolithic AI model, the project combines multiple Computer Vision and AI reasoning modules, making every decision explainable, debuggable and scalable.

# 🧠 AI Pipeline Explained

Unlike traditional surveillance systems, DrishtAI separates the problem into multiple intelligent stages.

Each module specializes in one task, producing structured information that becomes the input for the following module.

This design provides:

- Better debugging
- Easier scalability
- Transparent reasoning
- Faster development
- Easier model replacement

Every stage is independently testable.

---

# 📦 Pipeline Stages

---

## 🎥 Stage 1 — Frame Extraction

The pipeline begins by extracting frames from the uploaded CCTV footage.

### Responsibilities

- Read video sequentially
- Generate accurate timestamps
- Preserve original frame index
- Maintain timing precision
- Produce metadata for downstream modules

### Output

```text
FrameRecord
├── frame_index
├── timestamp
├── time_seconds
└── image_path
```

---

## 🚗 Stage 2 — Vehicle Detection

YOLOv8 detects every road vehicle present inside each frame.

Supported classes include:

- 🚗 Car
- 🚌 Bus
- 🏍 Motorcycle
- 🚛 Truck

Each detection includes

- Bounding Box
- Confidence
- Vehicle Type
- Position
- Timestamp

No tracking IDs are generated here because detection is stateless.

---

## 🎯 Stage 3 — Multi Object Tracking

Detected vehicles are passed to ByteTrack.

ByteTrack assigns a unique ID that persists across multiple frames.

Example

```text
Vehicle_1

Frame 1

↓

Frame 2

↓

Frame 3

↓

Frame 4

↓

Frame 200

Same Object ID
```

This persistent identity allows motion calculations across time.

Without tracking, speed and trajectory cannot be calculated.

---

## 📈 Stage 4 — Motion Mathematics

This module transforms tracked positions into meaningful motion.

For every tracked vehicle it calculates:

- Velocity (px/s)
- Direction
- Acceleration

It also smooths noisy trajectories to improve collision detection reliability.

Output example

```json
{
    "object_id":"vehicle_2",
    "velocity":184.4,
    "direction":91.7,
    "acceleration":-72.6
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Stage 5 — Collision Detection

Instead of relying on deep learning alone, DrishtAI uses explainable reasoning rules.

It evaluates

✔ Bounding-box distance

✔ Trajectory intersection

✔ Relative speed

✔ Sudden braking

✔ Sustained velocity changes

✔ Contact windows

Detected events include

```
moving_normally

↓

distance_dropping

↓

trajectory_intersecting

↓

sudden_velocity_change

↓

collision
```

---

## 🧩 Stage 6 — Timeline Builder

After all events have been detected, they are organized chronologically.

The Timeline Builder reconstructs the complete incident.

It also identifies

⭐ Earliest Observable Warning

This is the key innovation of DrishtAI.

Instead of only detecting collisions,

it identifies

**the first observable indication that the collision was becoming likely.**

---

## 🤖 Stage 7 — AI Explanation Layer

Structured JSON events are transformed into natural language using OpenAI GPT-4o Mini.

Example output

> Vehicle 2 and Vehicle 7 began rapidly closing distance at 00:14:32:14.

> Their trajectories intersected shortly afterward.

> A sudden decrease in velocity was detected before the collision occurred.

This enables investigators to understand incidents without reading raw JSON.

---

## 🖥 Stage 8 — Streamlit Review Console

The final stage presents everything through an interactive dashboard.

Features include

- Video Upload
- Live Progress
- Analysis Presets
- Timeline Viewer
- AI Report
- Event Search
- Evidence Viewer
- Metrics Dashboard

---

# ✅ You're Ready!

Once everything is installed, simply launch the Streamlit dashboard, upload a CCTV recording, and let DrishtAI analyze the footage—from vehicle detection to AI-generated incident explanations.

# 📊 Data Flow & JSON Schema

One of DrishtAI's core design principles is **structured communication between every pipeline stage**.

Instead of passing raw Python objects, each module produces standardized JSON records.

This allows:

- ✅ Modular development
- ✅ Easy debugging
- ✅ Pipeline transparency
- ✅ Independent testing
- ✅ Future scalability

---

# 🧩 Per Vehicle Record

Every tracked vehicle is represented using a structured JSON object.

```json
{
    "object_id": "vehicle_4",
    "timestamp": "00:14:32:08",
    "position": [412.3, 275.1],
    "velocity": 185.62,
    "direction": 91.3,
    "acceleration": -42.18,
    "event": "moving_normally"
}
```

---

## Field Descriptions

| Field | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| object_id | Persistent vehicle identifier generated by ByteTrack |
| timestamp | HH:MM:SS:FF timestamp |
| position | Bounding box centroid |
| velocity | Vehicle speed (pixels/second) |
| direction | Motion angle (0–360°) |
| acceleration | Change in velocity |
| event | Current detected event |

---

# 🚨 Event Timeline Record

Once collision detection has finished, DrishtAI converts motion records into a chronological event timeline.

Example

```json
{
    "timestamp":"00:14:32:14",
    "event":"distance_dropping",
    "objects_involved":[
        "vehicle_4",
        "vehicle_7"
    ],
    "is_earliest_warning":true,
    "time_seconds":872.4667,
    "frame_index":26174
}
```

---

## Timeline Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| timestamp | Human-readable timestamp |
| event | Event detected |
| objects_involved | Vehicles participating |
| is_earliest_warning | Whether this event marks the first warning |
| time_seconds | Precise floating-point timestamp |
| frame_index | Exact frame in original video |

---

# 📈 Example Event Timeline

# 🚗 Motion Analysis

For every tracked vehicle,

DrishtAI continuously measures

### Velocity

```
Speed = Distance / Time
```

Measured in

```
Pixels per Second
```

---

### Direction

Calculated using

```
atan2()

```

Produces

```
0° → Right

90° → Up

180° → Left

270° → Down
```

---

### Acceleration

```
Acceleration

=

ΔVelocity

────────────

ΔTime
```

Negative acceleration often indicates

- Hard Braking
- Impact
- Sudden Deceleration

---

# ⚠ Collision Detection Logic

A collision is **not** detected from a single frame.

Instead,

DrishtAI evaluates multiple observations over time.

---

## 1️⃣ Distance Dropping

The distance between two vehicles decreases consistently.

```

Vehicle A

──────►

◄──────

Vehicle B

```

---

## 2️⃣ Trajectory Intersection

Vehicle paths begin converging.

```

────►

╲

╲

◄────

```

---

## 3️⃣ Sudden Velocity Change

One or both vehicles rapidly lose speed.

Example

```
Before

180 px/s

↓

After

## 5️⃣ Collision Confirmed

Only after all previous indicators align,

DrishtAI generates

```
collision
```

---

# ⭐ Earliest Warning Detection

This is the most innovative part of DrishtAI.

Instead of asking

> "When did the accident happen?"

DrishtAI asks

> "When was the first observable sign that the accident was becoming likely?"

The Timeline Builder walks backwards from the collision event and finds the earliest risk-elevating event involving the same vehicles.

Example

```

Collision

↑

Sudden Velocity Change

↑

Trajectory Intersection

↑

⭐ Distance Dropping

Earliest Warning
```

---

# 🤖 AI Explanation Layer

The final stage converts structured event data into natural language.

Input

```json
[
 {
  "event":"distance_dropping"
 },
 {
  "event":"trajectory_intersecting"
 },
 {
  "event":"collision"
 }
]
```

Output

> Vehicle 4 and Vehicle 7 began rapidly closing distance at **00:14:32:14**. Shortly afterward, their trajectories intersected, followed by a sudden decrease in velocity. A collision was detected at **00:14:32:19**. The earliest observable warning occurred **1.43 seconds before the collision**, when the distance between both vehicles began decreasing significantly.

---

# 🔎 Ask the Footage

Instead of manually searching hours of surveillance,

users can simply ask

```
"When did the accident happen?"
```

```
"What caused the collision?"
```

```
"Which vehicles were involved?"
```

```
"Show me the earliest warning."
```

DrishtAI converts technical computer vision outputs into answers anyone can understand.

# 🎯 Why This Architecture?

DrishtAI is intentionally modular.

This makes it easy to:

- Replace YOLO with another detector
- Upgrade the tracking algorithm
- Improve collision logic
- Add new event types
- Support pedestrian detection
- Scale to real-time CCTV streams
- Integrate with emergency response systems

Every component can evolve independently while preserving the same JSON interface between stages.

# 🥇 Summer School '26 — AI First Hackathon

### IIT Jammu • Techible • Institute Innovation & Incubation Council (I3C)

</div>

DrishtAI was built as part of the **Summer School '26 AI First Hackathon**, where the objective was to create an innovative AI-driven solution capable of solving a real-world problem.

Rather than treating CCTV as a passive recording device, DrishtAI reimagines surveillance as an intelligent reasoning system capable of understanding events over time.

# 💡 Inspiration

The inspiration behind DrishtAI came from a simple observation:

> Cameras record everything, yet understanding still depends on humans.

We wanted to build a system that could transform surveillance footage into meaningful, searchable knowledge instead of passive recordings.
